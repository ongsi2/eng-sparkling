## 문제 유형별 기출 예시

### 1. 주제 찾기 (PICK_SUBJECT) - 20번

**지문:**
```
Values alone do not create and build culture. Living your values only some of the time does not contribute to the creation and maintenance of culture. Changing values into behaviors is only half the battle. Certainly, this is a step in the right direction, but those behaviors must then be shared and distributed widely throughout the organization, along with a clear and concise description of what is expected. It is not enough to simply talk about it. It is critical to have a visual representation of the specific behaviors that leaders and all people managers can use to coach their people. Just like a sports team has a playbook with specific plays designed to help them perform well and win, your company should have a playbook with the key shifts needed to transform your culture into action and turn your values into winning behaviors.
```

**선택지:**
1. Organizations need to establish core values that all members share to innovate culture.
2. Leaders must possess clear values to change organizational members' behaviors.
3. Organizational members' voluntary action must support shared culture.
4. Continuous communication among members is essential for realizing core organizational values.
5. Explicit guidelines for sharing value-reflecting behaviors are necessary for culture formation. ✓

**정답:** 5번

### 2. 밑줄 의미 (PICK_UNDERLINE) - 21번

**지문:**
```
How you focus your attention plays a critical role in how you deal with stress. Scattered attention harms your ability to let go of stress, because even though your attention is scattered, it is narrowly focused, for you are able to fixate only on the stressful parts of your experience. When your attentional spotlight is widened, you can more easily let go of stress. You can put in perspective many more aspects of any situation and not get locked into one part that ties you down to superficial and anxiety-provoking levels of attention. A narrow focus heightens the stress level of each experience, but a widened focus turns down the stress level because you're better able to put each situation into a broader perspective. One anxiety-provoking detail is less important than the bigger picture. It's like transforming yourself into a nonstick frying pan. You can still fry an egg, but the egg won't stick to the pan.
```

**밑줄 친 표현:** "a nonstick frying pan"

**선택지:**
1. Never being confronted with any stressful experiences in daily life
2. Broadening one's perspective to identify the cause of stress
3. Rarely confining one's attention to positive aspects of an experience
4. Having a larger view of an experience beyond its stressful aspects ✓
5. Taking stress into account as the source of developing a wide view

**정답:** 4번

### 3. 어법 (GRAMMAR_INCORRECT) - 29번

**지문:**
```
A number of studies provide substantial evidence of an innate human disposition to respond differentially to social stimuli. From birth, infants will orient preferentially towards the human face and voice, ① seeming to know that such stimuli are particularly meaningful for them. Moreover, they register this connection actively, imitating a variety of facial gestures that are presented to them ― tongue protrusions, lip tightenings, mouth openings. They will even try to match gestures ② which they have some difficulty, experimenting with their own faces until they succeed. When they ③ do succeed, they show pleasure by a brightening of their eyes; when they fail, they show distress. In other words, they not only have an innate capacity for matching their own kinaesthetically experienced bodily movements with ④ those of others that are visually perceived; they have an innate drive to do so. That is, they seem to have an innate drive to imitate others whom they judge ⑤ to be 'like me'.
```

**정답:** 2번 (which → that/with which)
- "gestures that they have some difficulty [matching]" 구조가 올바름
- 또는 "gestures with which they have some difficulty"

### 4. 어휘 (SELECT_INCORRECT_WORD) - 30번

**지문:**
```
Bazaar economies feature an apparently flexible price-setting mechanism that sits atop more enduring ties of shared culture. Both the buyer and seller are aware of each other's ① restrictions. In Delhi's bazaars, buyers and sellers can ② assess to a large extent the financial constraints that other actors have in their everyday life. Each actor belonging to a specific economic class understands what the other sees as a necessity and a luxury. In the case of electronic products like video games, they are not a ③ necessity at the same level as other household purchases such as food items. So, the seller in Delhi's bazaars is careful not to directly ask for very ④ low prices for video games because at no point will the buyer see possession of them as an absolute necessity. Access to this type of knowledge establishes a price consensus by relating to each other's preferences and limitations of belonging to a ⑤ similar cultural and economic universe.
```

**정답:** 4번 (low → high)
- 비디오 게임이 필수품이 아니므로 판매자는 "높은" 가격을 요구하지 않음

### 5. 빈칸 (BLANK_WORD) - 31번

**지문:**
```
Over the last decade the attention given to how children learn to read has foregrounded the nature of textuality, and of the different, interrelated ways in which readers of all ages make texts mean. 'Reading' now applies to a greater number of representational forms than at any time in the past: pictures, maps, screens, design graphics and photographs are all regarded as text. In addition to the innovations made possible in picture books by new printing processes, design features also predominate in other kinds, such as books of poetry and information texts. Thus, reading becomes a more complicated kind of interpretation than it was when children's attention was focused on the printed text, with sketches or pictures as an adjunct. Children now learn from a picture book that words and illustrations complement and enhance each other. Reading is not simply ___________. Even in the easiest texts, what a sentence 'says' is often not what it means.
```

**선택지:**
1. knowledge acquisition
2. word recognition ✓
3. imaginative play
4. subjective interpretation
5. image mapping

**정답:** 2번 (word recognition)

### 6. 무관한 문장 (IRRELEVANT_SENTENCE) - 35번

**지문:**
```
Speaking fast is a high-risk proposition. It's nearly impossible to maintain the ideal conditions to be persuasive, well-spoken, and effective when the mouth is traveling well over the speed limit.

① Although we'd like to think that our minds are sharp enough to always make good decisions with the greatest efficiency, they just aren't.

② In reality, the brain arrives at an intersection of four or five possible things to say and sits idling for a couple of seconds, considering the options.

③ Making a good decision helps you speak faster because it provides you with more time to come up with your responses.

④ When the brain stops sending navigational instructions back to the mouth and the mouth is moving too fast to pause, that's when you get a verbal fender bender, otherwise known as filler.

⑤ Um, ah, you know, and like are what your mouth does when it has nowhere to go.
```

**정답:** 3번
- 글의 흐름: "빠르게 말하기의 위험성"을 설명
- ③번은 "좋은 결정이 더 빠르게 말하게 해준다"는 반대 주장

### 7. 순서 (SENTENCE_ORDER) - 36번

**주어진 글:**
```
Negotiation can be defined as an attempt to explore and reconcile conflicting positions in order to reach an acceptable outcome.
```

**선택지 (A), (B), (C):**

**(A)** Areas of difference can and do frequently remain, and will perhaps be the subject of future negotiations, or indeed remain irreconcilable. In those instances in which the parties have highly antagonistic or polarised relations, the process is likely to be dominated by the exposition, very often in public, of the areas of conflict.

**(B)** In these and sometimes other forms of negotiation, negotiation serves functions other than reconciling conflicting interests. These will include delay, publicity, diverting attention or seeking intelligence about the other party and its negotiating position.

**(C)** Whatever the nature of the outcome, which may actually favour one party more than another, the purpose of negotiation is the identification of areas of common interest and conflict. In this sense, depending on the intentions of the parties, the areas of common interest may be clarified, refined and given negotiated form and substance.

**정답:** C - A - B (선택지 4번)

### 8. 문장 삽입 (INSERT_SENTENCE) - 38번

**삽입할 문장:**
```
Yes, some contests are seen as world class, such as identification of the Higgs particle or the development of high temperature superconductors.
```

**지문:**
```
Science is sometimes described as a winner-take-all contest, meaning that there are no rewards for being second or third. This is an extreme view of the nature of scientific contests. (①) Even those who describe scientific contests in such a way note that it is a somewhat inaccurate description, given that replication and verification have social value and are common in science. (②) It is also inaccurate to the extent that it suggests that only a handful of contests exist. (③) But many other contests have multiple parts, and the number of such contests may be increasing. (④) By way of example, for many years it was thought that there would be "one" cure for cancer, but it is now realized that cancer takes multiple forms and that multiple approaches are needed to provide a cure. (⑤) There won't be one winner ― there will be many.
```
